# Hi I'm Conan :wave:

I'm a self-taught developer beginning in November 2019 when I was introduced to software development as a possible career change. After using my free time going through development courses I was hooked and haven't looked back. Since then I've gone through more courses, lots of reading through documentation and other peoples work, plus following YouTube videos and creating alongside them. Fast forward to the present and I'm now a Juinior Developer working for [Blink SEO](https://www.blinkseo.co.uk/) and enrolled on a software development apprenticeship with [Just IT](https://www.justit.co.uk/). I am also working on a web app called 'Oh My Dawg', a community site for dogs. By working on this project I've combined and developed my learnt skills. Oh My Dawg is deployed on AWS using Docker, the back end is an Express web service working with a React front end.

### What is 'Oh My Dawg'? :poodle:
* Being developed with ReactJS for frontend, Node.js using express for rest API for backend
* Currently:
  * Multiple Dogs can be uploaded under 1 username during the signup process
  * Anyone can vote on other dogs once
* I plan to:
  * Develop a profile page for the user 
  * Enable users to search for other dogs using names/breed
  * Enable users to edit their dogs
  * Users to add one another as 'pals'
  * Develop a blog-like component that displays all posts and filtered posts for pals only
  * Users to message each other and plan walks
 
## What I've learnt
* Developing with ReactJS
* Understanding and using Node.js
* When I come across an error to understand why it is there and how to remedy it.
* How to containerised an App in Docker and deploy on a single EC2 instance
* How to implement NginX proxy pass
* SSL certs and implementing them with certbot
* Creating a script to build and run an app with one command

## What I'm going to learn
* How to implement all features listed on Oh My Dawgs' [roadmap](https://github.com/Chascript/ohmydawg)
* Auth0 to implement within Oh My Dawg (A secure user sign-in process)
* Deeper knowledge of JavaScript
