 # :wave: Hi I'm Conan (Co-nun)

:computer: I am a Front End Engineer at [Blink SEO](https://www.blinkseo.co.uk/), where my journey began as a Junior Developer. I successfully completed a software development apprenticeship with [Just IT](https://www.justit.co.uk/) while contributing to various projects at Blink SEO. Among these, a standout achievement was the development of a dynamic SEO friendly faceted navigation component within Shopify, without relying on JavaScript.

:book: Driven by a passion for continuous learning, I am currently immersed in Harvard's CS50 course, strengthening my foundational knowledge. Following the completion of CS50, my focus will shift towards mastering Next.js, expanding my skill set to create dynamic and efficient web applications.

:poodle: Beyond the realm of coding, I find joy in the company of my two poodles and maintain a lifestyle through activities such as running, agility and challenging myself in the world of CrossFit.

:relaxed: I am always eager to explore new opportunities and challenges.

:telescope: Right now, I'm working on a Next.js project for my job and also on a personal Next.js project about [CrossFit](https://github.com/Chascript/Crossfit) in my free time. I want to use what I learn from both to help both projects and build up my skills.
