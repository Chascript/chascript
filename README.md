# Hi I'm Conan :wave:

* I'm a self taught developer begining in November 2019 when I was introduced to software development as a possible career change and was sugguested to take a look at Codecademy. After spending the whole weekend doing development exercises I was hooked and haven't looked back. Since then I've gone through multiple Codecademy courses, lots of reading through documentation and other peoples work, plus following YouTube videos and creating alongside with them. Fast forward to the present and I'm working on a web app called 'Oh My Dawg', a community site for dogs. By working on this project I've combined and developed my learnt skills. Oh My Dawg is deployed on AWS using Docker, the back end is an Express web service working with a React front end. (Am focusing on getting this live end of November 2020). 

## What I've learnt
* Developing with ReactJS
* Understanding and using Node.js
* When I come across an error to understand why it is there and how to remedy it.
* How to containerised an App in Docker and deploy on a single EC2 instance

## What I'm going to learn
* NginX and Auth0 to impliemnt within Oh My Dawg
* Deeper knowledge of JavaScript
* More work on problem solving - Leet code
